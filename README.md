# bent-bot
 A Discord bot made with JDA, JDA-Utilities, gradle.
 
 This bot was made for a small server I'm in and is primarily meant to just be used in there. However, if you so wish you may invite it to your own server with the link above. As well, I've provided all the files necessary to run your own instance of the bot.
 
# Features
  More specific command list and help can be found with the ``help`` command inside the bot itself.
  * Grab an avatar
  * Get Archillect posts
  * Server join and leave notifications
  * GARFIELD
  * Warframe commands
 
### Invite the Bot
  If you'd like to add the bot to your own server you can do so by clicking the invite link above or right [here][invite]. I'm not guarunteeing any uptime, and I will occasionally take it offline either to fix things or add more stuff. If you have any basic questions or want to tell me about a problem you can create a new issue.

### Run Your Own Version
  Download the files to host your own version of the bot [here][download], but don't expect me to help if you have any issues. I will not explain how to get it running yourself or how to create a bot application with the Discord API. You can download all the source code and make whatever changes you want for yourself, but don't pretend it's yours. 

### Contribute
  You actually want to help and add more to this throwaway bot? Sure, just create a pull request.
  
  
### TO DO (since release)
- [ ] Add option to enable and disable notifications
- [ ] Fix minor warframe wiki command bugs
- [ ] Enjoy
